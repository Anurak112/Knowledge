# Hooks

Hooks are event triggers that execute actions at specific points in the agent's lifecycle.

## Categories

-   **`pre-commit/`**: Actions to run before committing changes (e.g., linting).
-   **`post-response/`**: Actions to run after the agent sends a response (e.g., logging).

## Format

Hooks are typically executable scripts or command definitions.
