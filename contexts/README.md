# Contexts

Contexts define the "environment" or "focus" of an agent. A context file might specify a subset of files to be aware of, a specific project vocabulary, or a set of active memories.

## Structure

-   **`project/`**: Contexts specific to a project.
-   **`domain/`**: Contexts specific to a knowledge domain.
