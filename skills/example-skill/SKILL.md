# Overview

This is an example skill that teaches an agent how to structure its output in a specific way.

# Instructions

1.  **Analyze the Request**: Determine if the user is asking for a specific format.
2.  **Format Output**:
    -   Use headers for main sections.
    -   Use bullet points for lists.
3.  **Validation**: Ensure the output contains no prohibited words defined in `resources/banned_words.txt` (hypothetically).

# Examples

Refer to `examples/usage.md` for specific input/output pairs.
